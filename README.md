# MovieGenreClassifier
This repository contains a project on Movie Genre Classification using multi-label classification techniques. The system processes movie plots and predicts multiple genres associated with each movie. The implementation uses NLP techniques , TF-IDF , and a Logistic Regression model wrapped in a One-vs-Rest classifier for genre prediction.
